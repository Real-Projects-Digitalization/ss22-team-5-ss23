# TransitTrail

## The Story
![Storyboard](https://github.com/Real-Projects-Digitalization/ss22-team-5-ss23/blob/main/StoryboardV2.png)
Niam(mother), Kami (father) and Miria (child) are standing at a bus stop in Germany. They have recently arrived in the country as a refugee family and want to use public transportation to get to the shelter. But they have trouble understanding the instructions on the timetables and are unsure which bus to take.

The family asks a pedestrian for help, but the man doesn't speak English and doesn't understand their mother language. They feel helpless and lost.

A few minutes later, Niam remembers that the Bavarian Red Cross (BRK) had recommended an app to help them find their way around public transportation. They open the app on their smartphone and enter the destination address.

The app shows them not only the exact bus they need to take, but also how to buy the ticket and where to board the bus. Miria and Kami are relieved and grateful for the help they received from the "TransitTrail" app. Niam buys the ticket through the app and shows her child where to sit on the bus.

They take the bus and arrive at their destination without any further problems. Niam, Miria, and Kami are relieved and happy to have found the help they needed to use public transportation in Germany. They feel a little more arrived in their new home.
